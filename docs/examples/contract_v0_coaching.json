The hardest part is almost always just starting.\n\nHere's what I've noticed: our brains protect us from overwhelming things by making them feel impossible. But once we take even the tiniest action, that wall starts to crumble.\n\nWhat if we made this ridiculously small? I'm talking just touching the folder. Not opening it, not doing anything with it - just putting your hand on it for 10 seconds. That's the whole task.\n\nIf that feels okay, you could peek inside. Count the papers. That's it.\n\nWould you be willing to try just touching the folder right now?",
